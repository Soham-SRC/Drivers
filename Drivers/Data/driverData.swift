        Kimi Raikkonen is one of the most talented drivers to have graced this sport in the modern era.
        
        The 2007 World Champion, of Finland, has thrilled fans worldwide during the last two decades and has become a firm favourite amongst the fans.

        Starting out at Sauber in 2001 at just 21 years of age, the infamous character of Raikkonen became apparent immediately after it was discovered he had been asleep half an hour before his debut.
        Nonetheless, the talent was there for all to see as he scored nine points and finished in fourth place twice.
        Kimi’s strong start to his F1 career was enough to raise interest from McLaren, and they immediately signed him as fellow Finn and double World Champion Mika Hakkinen’s replacement for the 2002 season.

        In a year dominated by Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, Raikkonen impressed. He scored his first podium in his first race for McLaren in Australia.

        Three more podiums followed as he finished the 2002 season with 24 points. He would have had many more had it not been for McLaren’s appalling reliability and Mercedes big engine problems.
        The 2003 F1 season was when Raikkonen started to realise his true potential as he almost beat Schumacher to the World Championship. Malaysia, the second race of the season, was the destination for his first race win as he dominated the rest of the field. with the second-place finisher, Rubens Barrichello, finishing 39 seconds behind.
        He followed that up with victory in his next race in Brazil, although it was later awarded to Giancarlo Fisichella and consistent podiums in Austria, Monaco, Britain and Hungary made him a true contender. However, the McLaren didn’t have enough to compete with the stronger Ferrari and Schumacher clinched the title in Japan, despite Kimi scoring two further podiums in USA and Japan.

        2004 was again dominated by Ferrari, but 2005 is arguably remembered as the best season of Kimi’s career. Seven wins and a tantalising championship fight with Fernando Alonso were enough to launch Formula 1 into a new era, with these two young drivers at the forefront.

        Four world championships. 53 race victories. 32 years of age. These stats are quite incredible and have been set by an incredible driver. Sebastian Vettel may split opinion but no one can deny he is, statistically, one of the greatest drivers of all time.

        The German has benefited from having the best car on the grid, but now he needs to prove that he isn’t just a flat track bully. Taking Ferrari back to the top, would cement his status as a great.

        Vettel is one of a number of young racing drivers inspired by the great Michael Schumacher, Vettel’s fellow German. And like the seven-time champion Vettel shares his ruthless personality, steely determination and above all, blistering speed
        His career threatened to mimic Michael’s, as he joined Ferrari in 2015 with the task of making them dominant once again, after a disappointing end to a brilliant time at Red Bull.

        His first season in red was sensational. Three wins and 10 other podiums were the results of a driver back to his very best.

        Vettel made his debut in 2007 with BMW Sauber, as a replacement for the injured Robert Kubica. He was 19 and managed to score a debut point.

        Torro Rosso handed him a full-time drive the following season. The sister team to Red Bull presented the German with a chance to shine. And he did.

        On a wet weekend in Monza, Italy he took pole position and then a comprehensive debut win, becoming the youngest driver in history to win a Grand Prix. The world took notice.
        Red Bull came calling the following 2009 F1 season and Vettel was thrust into a title battle. Jenson Button and Brawn F1 dominated the early stages but Vettel kept himself in contention with wins at the likes of China, Britain and Japan. He finished as runner-up and added a fourth victory of the year in Abu Dhabi.

        The following year is fondly remembered as one of the sport’s best ever, as Vettel battled it out with team-mate Mark Webber, Fernando Alonso, Button and Lewis Hamilton in a title fight that went to the wire.

        Vettel’s racing skills were questioned after incidents in Spa, Silverstone and Budapest,  but a blistering end to the season put him in with a chance in the finale at Abu Dhabi. A faultless drive and a portion of fortune saw him claim the world championship.

        2011 was far easier, the Red Bull RB7 was the stand-out car and it saw Vettel win 11 races.  A second championship was easy.

        Lewis Hamilton is one of the fastest drivers of his generation. When he entered Formula 1 back in 2007 he amazed the world by his performance. He finished 3rd on his first race and astonished the bookmakers. In his rookie year, he also was very close to winning the World Drivers' title. If you would have put some money on that at the US bookmakers, you would have won a lot of money.

        The 34-year-old is now a six-time world champion after his success in 2008, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and he drives the sport's fastest car.

        Race wins should keep flowing and championships could start to total up, as the Englishman looks to cement his legacy as one of the sport's greats.

        Hamilton’s bold move to Mercedes in 2013, which many thought would go badly, has reinvigorated him.  After being on the books of McLaren since boyhood, he clearly needed a change from the team which helped him become world champion.

        Hamilton’s time with McLaren soured towards the end, but it is worth noting that they enjoyed a unique driver/team relationship.
        At the age of ten, Hamilton approached McLaren boss Ross Dennis and told him “I want to race for you one day ... I want to race for McLaren.” Less than a year later Hamilton was signed to the young drivers’ school, the rest, as they say, is history.

        Dennis saw in Hamilton the drive and ability to become one of the sport's finest ever. Much hype surrounded Lewis, and that only increased when it was announced that he would make his F1 debut for McLaren in 2007. Only special drivers start their career at a top team.

        On his debut in Australia, he came third, the next race second, and in just his sixth start in Canada, he took his maiden victory. To prove it wasn't a one-off, he did it again in the USA a week later and mounted a genuine title challenge.

        His team-mate, and defending double-world champion, Fernando Alonso didn't like the equal status he shared with the Brit, and they fell out spectacularly, with the Spaniard taking most of the blame. Alonso, McLaren’s prize signing, left at the end of the season.

        The self-styled “Honey Badger” is fuzzy on the outside and feisty on the inside. Drivers beware because behind Ricciardo’s laidback persona and big grin is a razor-sharp racer with a bite.

        The Australian combines all-out speed with impressive race craft. Never afraid to push to the limits if it means pulling off a pass, Ricciardo is a proven race-winner, capable of consistently finishing at the business end of the championship table given the right machinery.

        A regular podium-finisher in his days with Red Bull, Ricciardo has christened the steps around the world with a dousing of Aussie culture – the ‘Shoey’ – as he quaffed champagne from a soggy racing boot. Yes it’s goofy, but the trademark celebration illustrates why he is loved for his sense of humour but never underestimated on track.

        His career’s next move to Renault’s works team in 2019 brought fresh challenges for the Perth pilot, but failed to deliver his dream of following Jack Brabham and Alan Jones as the next world champion from Down Under and he moved on to McLaren for 2021.

        There he has found a tough young team mate in Lando Norris, but has nevertheless returned to winning ways. Whatever happens next, Ricciardo is sure to keep on smiling.

        This British upcoming F1 driver became the youngest ever world karting champion at the age of 14. In 2016 he won the Formula Renault Eurocup and NEC 2.0 title. In 2017 he was given a reward for winning the 2016 McLaren Autosport BRDC Award. The reward was testing a Formula One car in 2017 on the Hungaroring in the week after the grand prix.

        He tested the McLaren MCL32 on the 2nd of August 2017 and hugely impressed the world by delivered a fantastic performance at the wheel of the (normally poor performing) McLaren’s MCL32 car to be only 0.261s slower then that day’s fastest man and 4 times F1 champions, Sebastian Vettel.

        Norris’ quickest lap was set on ultrasoft tyes, a step softer in Pirelli’s range than the supersofts utilised by Vettel for his fastest time, but even taking the performance difference of the tyres into account, ther 17-year-old’s F1 debut was eye-catching as he posted 91 laps.

        Norris now drives the FIA Formula 3 European Championship and holds 2nd place in the drivers championship.

        As the son of a former World Rally Champion who shares his name, Carlos Sainz has a racing pedigree that matched his first team-mate Max Verstappen, son of Jos Verstappen.

        Sainz and Verstappen did some a battle at Toro Rosso in 2015, in what is one of the most fascinating sub-plots to an intriguing season.

        Sainz is a latecomer to the grid, as he wasn’t expected to be racing in Formula 1 in 2015.

        Sebastian Vettel’s move to Ferrari freed up some room at Red Bull and the management picked Toro Rosso’s Daniil Kvyat.
        However, Sainz should not be taken lightly. His junior career is impressive and it is clear he has raw speed and potential. But the 20-year-old has been fast-tracked into motorsport’s top division after just a solitary season in GP3 and a Formula Renault 3.5 championship last season.

        Toro Rosso are were confident that Sainz would be a success, and both they and Red Bull were impressed with how he has performed in testing events. That’s no substitute for the real thing though, and Sainz will be scrutinised from the start.

        2016 was a good season for Carlos he scored 46 points and finished 6th as best result in 3 races. If it wasn't for Max Verstappen he certainly would have replaced Daniil Kvyat instead of Max. The Toro Rosso STR11 was a very good chassis, except the 2015 Ferrari power unit wasn't up to the job to show their real speed.
